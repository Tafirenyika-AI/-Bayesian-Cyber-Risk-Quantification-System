This project is a **Streamlit-powered web application** that uses **Bayesian inference with MCMC simulation** to quantify the financial impact of cyber risks such as phishing, DDoS attacks, and insider threats. It allows users to simulate data, run probabilistic models, and interpret results in plain language.
